The order, issued on November 28, 2025, instructed companies including Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi to bundle the app within 90 days and ensure it could not be disabled or deleted by users. The mandate quickly triggered a wave of public criticism, opposition backlash, and concerns from digital rights groups who warned that such a requirement could erode privacy and open the door to surveillance.</p>
<p>Apple rejected the mandate on the grounds that it violates its core security and privacy principles. The company argued that its iOS ecosystem is built on a tightly controlled walled garden structure, and preloading a non-removable state app would require system-level permissions that Apple does not grant to third parties under any circumstances. Allowing such access, Apple said, would weaken device security, enlarge the attack surface, and undermine global standards the company maintains in all markets. The position is consistent with earlier instances where Apple resisted mandates viewed as infringing on user rights or compromising device integrity.</p>
<p>While other manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi appeared prepared to comply with the directive, Apple communicated its objections through private channels and signaled that it would not alter its operating system safeguards to satisfy the order. As the news spread, a significant public outcry followed, with social media debates erupting over fears that a non-removable government app could track calls, monitor user activity, or serve as a surveillance tool. The Opposition demanded parliamentary scrutiny, accused the government of forcing a snooping app onto citizens, and called for an immediate rollback.</p>
<p>Amid mounting criticism and political heat, the government began shifting its position. On December 2, 2025, Union Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia issued a clarification that effectively amounted to a U turn. He stated that Sanchar Saathi is optional for users, can be uninstalled at any time, and does not collect or monitor personal data. Scindia insisted that the government's intention behind preloading the app was purely to increase awareness about telecom cybersecurity, fraud detection, and assistance in reporting lost or stolen phones. He assured citizens that the app poses no threat to privacy and that registering on it is voluntary.</p>
<p>The minister also highlighted that the Sanchar Saathi initiative had already helped block millions of fraudulent mobile connections and prevented widespread misuse of SIM cards. He reiterated that the government's objective is to enhance digital safety rather than impose restrictions on users. Following the clarification, officials emphasized that users would remain fully in control of whether they want to keep or delete the app.</p>
<p>However, even with the U turn, Apple is expected to maintain its stance that any requirement to preload apps, even deletable ones, contradicts core iOS principles by installing software without the user's explicit consent. Apple is likely to continue private discussions with the government while firmly protecting its ecosystem norms.</p>
<p>As consultations between the government and smartphone manufacturers continue, the episode underscores the growing tensions between tech companies, user privacy concerns, and state digital policy. For now, Apple has refused to preload Sanchar Saathi, public and political pressure has forced the government to soften its mandate, and the issue remains a focal point in the ongoing debate over digital rights and security in India.</p></div><div class="article-sharing" style="margin:40px 0;padding:20px;background:#f8f9fa;text-align:center;border-radius:8px"><h3 style="color:#b91c1c;margin-bottom:20px;border-left:none;padding-left:0">Share this article</h3><div class="social-sharing" style="display:flex;gap:12px;justify-content:center"><button class="social-btn twitter" onclick="shareOnTwitter()"><i class="fab fa-x-twitter"></i></button><button class="social-btn facebook" onclick="shareOnFacebook()"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></button><button class="social-btn whatsapp" onclick="shareOnWhatsApp()"><i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i></button><button class="social-btn copy" onclick="copyArticleLink()"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></button></div></div><a href="../index.html" class="back-link" style="display:inline-block;color:#dc2626;text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold;padding:10px 20px;border:2px solid #dc2626;border-radius:4px">← Back to Home</a></article><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Fact Pilgrim.
