Vajpayee remembered Nehru in these words:</p>
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>
<p>A dream has been left unfulfilled, a song has fallen silent, a flame has merged into infinity. The dream was of a world free from fear and hunger, the song was of an epic that echoed with the Gita and was fragrant with roses. The flame was of a lamp that kept burning through the night, fighting every darkness and showing us the way, and then, at dawn, attained nirvana.</p>
<p>Death is inevitable, the body is mortal. The golden form that we consigned to the sandalwood pyre yesterday was destined to perish. But was it necessary for death to arrive so stealthily? When companions were asleep, when the guards were unaware, an invaluable treasure of our lives was lost. Mother India today is steeped in grief, she has lost her most beloved prince. Humanity today is dejected, its priest has fallen asleep. Peace is restless today, its guardian has departed. The support of the oppressed has slipped away. The apple of the nation s eye has been torn away. The curtain has fallen. The leading actor on the world stage has performed his final role and disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Maharishi Valmiki, while speaking of Lord Ram in the Ramayana, said that he was a reconciliation of impossibilities. In Panditjis life too, one sees a glimpse of that very description by the great poet. He was a worshipper of peace, yet a harbinger of revolution, a devotee of non violence, yet a proponent of fighting with every weapon for the defence of freedom and honour.</p>
<p>He was a supporter of individual liberty, yet committed to bringing about economic equality. He was never afraid to compromise, yet he never compromised out of fear. His policy towards Pakistan and China was a symbol of this remarkable synthesis, there was generosity in it, and there was firmness too. Unfortunately, this generosity was mistaken for weakness, while some interpreted his firmness as obstinacy.</p>
<p>I recall that during the days of the Chinese aggression, when our Western friends were trying to persuade us to reach some understanding with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, I once found him greatly angered. When he was told that if there were no compromise on Kashmir we would have to fight on two fronts, he bristled and said that if necessary, we would fight on both fronts. He was opposed to negotiations under pressure.</p>
<p>Sir, the freedom of which he was a fighter and a guardian stands imperilled today. We must defend it with all our strength. The national unity and integrity that he nurtured are also in danger today, we must preserve them at any cost. The Indian democracy that he established and made successful is also facing doubts about its future. Through our unity, discipline, and self confidence, we must prove this democracy successful. The leader has gone, the followers remain. The sun has set, in the light of the stars, we must find our path.</p>
<p>This is a time of great trial. If we all dedicate ourselves to a lofty purpose, under which India becomes strong, capable and prosperous, and contributes with self respect to the lasting establishment of world peace, only then will we succeed in offering him a true tribute. His absence in Parliament will never be filled. Perhaps no one will ever give such meaning to the existence of Teen Murti again. That personality, that vitality, that ability to carry even opponents along, that dignity, that greatness, these may not be seen in the near future. Despite differences of opinion, in our hearts there is nothing but respect for his great ideals, his integrity, his patriotism, and his indomitable courage.</p>
<p>With these words, I offer my humble tribute to that great soul.</p>
